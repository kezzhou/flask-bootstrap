# flask-bootstrap
HHA 504 // Week 3 // Assignment 3 // Part 2

## In this repo we build on the basics of manual html and css styling by downloading custom elements from Bootstrap, a free resource on the web: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/accordion/

## This repo utilizes code and resources originally compiled in: https://github.com/kezzhou/flask-html.

## The Song of the Day page is updated with a Card element, which contains a link to the song discussed in the page text. The Leech page is updated with a Toast element, which appears (with no functionality) as a side-bar chat for page viewers.

## All html files are nested in the templates folder, css in static, and accompanying screenshots of the functioning site are in the screenshots folder.
